# My electrophoresis sense is tingling

## Predictive maintenance
When will an electrophoresis plant require maintenance? Predicting if it will require maintenance using previous values of sensor readings.

## Why this was done
Time series data is a new challenge and I wanted to combine this with a library I've been exploring `tsai` (fastai extension focused on time series). 

Simply put maintenance costs time and money. If you are running a manufacturing plant or in this case a electrophoresis plant, machinery will require maintenance. If it is not maintained you can have delays in production/progress whether it's a fault that needs to be fixed or even clean up work if something may overflow. Maintenance can be solved by having people on duty (night and day) to be ready in the event of a failure. The issue with this is that it costs money to have someone available and on site nearly 24/7 and the people on duty aren't necessarily enjoying their work as nothing may be occuring. This model could lessen that.
